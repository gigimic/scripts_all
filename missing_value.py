# 3 treatments are explained here about treating missing values
# 1. drop columns with missing values
# 2. imputation - replace the missing value with the mean
# 3. imputation - after imputing the missing values, keep track of the imputed values

#1.  Drop columns with missing values
# Get names of columns with missing values
# X_train is the training data
# X_valid is the validation data
cols_with_missing = [col for col in X_train.columns
                     if X_train[col].isnull().any()]

# Drop columns in training and validation data
reduced_X_train = X_train.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)
reduced_X_valid = X_valid.drop(cols_with_missing, axis=1)

#2. imputation
# SimpleImputer replace the missing value with the mean
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train))
imputed_X_valid = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train.columns = X_train.columns
imputed_X_valid.columns = X_valid.columns

# 3. An extension to imputation
# we impute the missing values, while also keeping track of which values were imputed
# Make copy to avoid changing original data (when imputing)
X_train_plus = X_train.copy()
X_valid_plus = X_valid.copy()

# Make new columns indicating what will be imputed
for col in cols_with_missing:
    X_train_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_train_plus[col].isnull()
    X_valid_plus[col + '_was_missing'] = X_valid_plus[col].isnull()

# Imputation
my_imputer = SimpleImputer()
imputed_X_train_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.fit_transform(X_train_plus))
imputed_X_valid_plus = pd.DataFrame(my_imputer.transform(X_valid_plus))

# Imputation removed column names; put them back
imputed_X_train_plus.columns = X_train_plus.columns
imputed_X_valid_plus.columns = X_valid_plus.columns

# imputation performed better than dropping the columns

# Shape of training data (num_rows, num_columns)
print(X_train.shape)

# Number of missing values in each column of training data
missing_val_count_by_column = (X_train.isnull().sum())
print(missing_val_count_by_column[missing_val_count_by_column > 0])
