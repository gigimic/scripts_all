# and Google Drive APIs for your Google account.

# https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com/
# https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com/

# The following files should be kept in the same folder as the python script
# A credentials file named credentials-sheets.json
# A token for Google Sheets named token-sheets.pickle
# A token for Google Drive named token-drive.pickle

# Go to the Google Sheets Python Quickstart page at 
# https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python/
