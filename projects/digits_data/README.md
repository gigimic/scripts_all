Digits Recognition
-------------------

Digits data (pixel data) from the sklearn library is used in digits_svm code.
SVM model is used. Tried two kernels ('rbf'  and 'linear').
The scores are calculated using sklearn.metrics libraries
(confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, f1_score)

Kaggle digits data is used in svm2 code. It has 42000 images in the 
training data. Here svm model with kernel= 'linear' is used
In read_data.py the svm kernel = 'rbf' is used
